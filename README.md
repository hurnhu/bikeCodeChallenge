# Lets build a bike
challenge to build a bike with symfony and oop. Originally I did not have symfony and composer installed and set up. A good portion of the second break was setting up symfony, composer, and reinstalling newer php.

over all spent roughly 3 hours on this.
there were several more things i would have liked to implement like gears, chain (chain made up of multiple links), etc. 

in this appication you can ride a bike or a motorcycle.

A bike is made up of a user defined amount of tires and extend a base class of Vehicle.
A Motor cycle has a user defined amount of tires and extends a bike
